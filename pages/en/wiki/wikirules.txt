====== TECH SAVIOURS wiki ======

The wiki is powered by [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki|DokuWiki]] in combination with the [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:bootstrap3?s[]=bootstrap3|Bootstrap3]] template.

===== Contributing to wiki =====

Like any open source project, it lives from the efforts of its users.

The documentation can always be improved, or you can create more tutorials. But they must be easy to read and generally understandable to a complete newcomer who want more digital privacy but don't know how to achieve it.

===== GitHub or registration =====

The normal procedure fork/pull requests on [[https://github.com/TECH-SAVIOURS-ORG/wiki/|GitHub]] or send us an email to [[wiki@techsaviours.org?Subject=Registration%20Request|wiki@techsaviours.org]]  if you prefer to register on the [[https://wiki.techsaviours.org|wiki website]] itself, as we do not have registration enabled.

===== Syntax =====

You can use the [[en:wiki:syntax|DokuWiki's syntax]]. We tried to implement [[https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/|Markdown]], but unfortunately it doesn't really work. Too many failures with plugins or core. 

===== Structure =====

The wiki is mainly structured in 4 parts ([[https://www.dokuwiki.org/namespaces|namespaces]]):
   * Server
     * Operating Systems
     * Services
   * Phone
     * Operating Systems
     * Apps
   * Desktop
     * Operating Systems
     * Services
   * Extras

There is also ''faq'' and probably more will follow.  
  
If the tutorials are the same (e.g. desktop and server), create the page and add a link to it

<code>{{page>en:server:services:name}}</code>

<alert type="warning">{{icon>info}} Always add the link from the desktop to the server. This makes it easier to change the tutorials in the future.</alert>
