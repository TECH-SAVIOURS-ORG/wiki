====== AUR-Helper ======

We use mainly [[https://github.com/actionless/pikaur|pikaur]]. Feel free to add your favorite helper.

===== Pikaur =====

AUR helper with minimal dependencies. Review PKGBUILDs all in once, next build them all without user interaction.

Inspired by ''pacaur'', ''yaourt'' and ''yay''.

Instead of trying to be smarter than pacman (by using ''--nodeps'', ''--force'', ''--ask'', ''--noconfirm'' and so) it just interactively tells pacman what to do. If pacman asks some unexpected question, the user will be just able to answer it manually.

==== Packages ====

<code>
pacman -S base-devel git
</code>

==== Installation ====

<code>
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pikaur.git
cd pikaur
makepkg -fsri
