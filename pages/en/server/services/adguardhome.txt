====== AdGuard Home ======

[[https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html|AdGuard Home]] is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it’ll cover ALL your home devices, and you don’t need any client-side software for that. With the rise of Internet-Of-Things and connected devices, it becomes more and more important to be able to control your whole network.

More advanced information in their [[https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardHome|GitHub repository]].


===== Installation =====

<code>
curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -v
</code>

Check if it's running:
<code>
systemctl status AdGuardHome.service
</code>

<alert type="info" icon="fa fa-info-circle">Files are under ''/opt/AdGuardHome/''</alert>


==== Web Interface ====

Go to ''http://server-ip:3000'' and follow the instructions:

{{:en:server:services:adguardhome-welcome.png?direct|}}


Change the port number if you use [[/en/server/services/nginx]] or something else. Check also [[/en/server/services/ssl]]. Leave the rest as it is:

{{:en:server:services:adguardhome-admin_web_interface.png?direct|}}


Set your admin user:

{{:en:server:services:adguardhome-authentication.png?direct|}}


Configure your router to route all DNS requests to your AdGuard Home Server so that all devices on your network can benefit from the new DNS server:

That's it:

===== Unbound & DNSCrypt =====

If you're going to use [[/en/server/services/unbound]] and/or [[/en/server/services/dnscrypt]] you'll need to change the ''Upstream DNS servers'':

===== DNS blocklists =====

Go to https://firebog.net/ and chose whatever you want to block. Also search for something like [[https://searx.techsaviours.org/search?q=Blocklist%20for%20AdGuard%20or%20PiHole|Blocklist for AdGuard or PiHole]]

{{:en:server:services:adguardhome-dns_blocklists.png?direct|}}


===== DNS rewrites  =====

If you're going to use for example [[/en/server/services/ssl]] it's an easy task to add all your server domains like ''nextcloud.home'' to AdGuard Home instead of your router or ''/etc/hosts'' file.

{{:en:server:services:adguardhome-dns_rewrites.png.png?direct|}}

{{:en:server:services:adguardhome-add_dns_rewrite.png?direct|}}

You can also add the domains under:

<code>
nano /opt/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml
</code>

<code>
dns:
  rewrites:
    - domain: nextcloud.home
      answer: YOUR-IP
    - domain: searx.home
      answer: YOUR-IP
</code>

<code>
systemctl restart AdGuardHome.service
</code>


===== Uninstall =====

<code>
curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -vu
</code>
