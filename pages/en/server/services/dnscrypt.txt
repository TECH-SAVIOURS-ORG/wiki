====== DNSCrypt ======

[[https://dnscrypt.info/|DNSCrypt]] is a protocol that encrypts, authenticates and optionally anonymizes communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and havenâ€™t been tampered with.

It is an open specification, with free and open source reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with any company nor organization.

Free, DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers are available all over the world.

===== Config file =====

Change your ''dnscrypt-proxy.toml'' config file.

<code>
nano /etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml
</code>

==== server_names ====

<code>
server_names = ['techsaviours.org-dnscrypt']

If you're going to use [[/en/server/services/unbound|Unbound]] and [[/en/server/services/adguardhome|AdGuardHome]] you'll need to change the ''listen_addresses'' as well.

<code>
listen_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:5300']
</code>
==== Anonymized DNS ====

Go to the bottom ''routes = ['' and add:  

<code>
routes = [
    { server_name='2.dnscrypt-cert.techsaviours.org', via=['anon-techsaviours.org'] }
]
</code>

<code>
systemctl enable --now dnscrypt-proxy.service
</code>

<alert type="info" icon="fa fa-info-circle">Any changes to ''/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml'' requires a restart of the service. Keep that in mind.</alert>
