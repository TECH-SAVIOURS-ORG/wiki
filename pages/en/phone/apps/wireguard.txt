====== WireGuard ======

WireGuard is a next generation secure network tunnel protocol. This application allows users to connect to WireGuard tunnels. More information may be found on
the [[https://www.wireguard.com/|project webpage]].

If your device has a custom kernel containing the WireGuard module, then the module will be used for superior battery life and performance. Otherwise a
userspace version will work sufficiently on all other devices.
