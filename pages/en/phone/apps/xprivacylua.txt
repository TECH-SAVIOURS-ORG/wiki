====== XPrivacyLua ======

Really simple to use privacy manager for Android 6.0 Marshmallow and later
(successor of XPrivacy).

Revoking Android permissions from apps often let apps crash or malfunction.
XPrivacyLua solves this by feeding apps fake data instead of real data.


===== Download and install apk =====

Install XPrivacyLua via [[en:phone:apps:f-droid|F-Droid]] - https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.xlua/.


===== Enable module =====

You may receive a notification after the installation. Enable the module in [[en:phone:apps:lsposed|LSPosed]] and enable any app you want to give fake data too. Restart your device.

<alert type="danger" icon="fa fa-warning">Each new app installation must be manually activated in LSPosed! Do not forget this!</alert>


===== Settings =====

Click on the burger (top left) and mark ''Notify on new apps'' and ''Restrict new apps''.
