====== Browser ======


===== Iceraven =====

Iceraven Browser is a web browser for Android, based on [[https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/|Mozilla's Fenix version of Firefox]], [[https://mozilla.github.io/geckoview/|GeckoView]] and [[https://mozac.org/|Mozilla Android Components]].

Our goal is to be a close fork of the new Firefox for Android that seeks to provide users with more options, more opportunities to customize (including a broad extension library), and more information about the pages they visit and how their browsers are interacting with those pages.
