====== Donation list ======

Our wiki is finally ready to use, and we thought it would be great to create a donation list with all the listed tutorials and services we provide. For easier support of your favourite free and open source software or all of them ;)\\
None of this would be possible and we would all be totally dependent on Google & Co.

We follow the wiki structure and the services we provide. If a service/app shows up twice, like WireGuard under [[/en/server]] and [[/en/phone]], you will find the link under [[#Server/Desktop_(Linux)]]. It will not be listed twice.

So here are all the donation links (if available) of everything we have here (apart from dependencies):
