Audible feedback on just how much your browsing feeds into Google.

Makes a little bit of noise any time your computer sends a packet to a Google service, which excludes Google Cloud users.

Thanks bert! 

===== Installation on Arch =====

==== Packages ====
<code>
sudo pacman -Sy pcaudiolib gcc ipset bpftrace tcpdump
</code>

==== Build ====
<code>
git clone https://github.com/berthubert/googerteller.git
cd googerteller
cmake .
make
</code>

==== Define an ip(6)tables ====
Google is so large its IPv4 and IPv6 footprint can't be handled by tcpdump, or at least not efficiently. Therefore we need to define an ip(6)tables ipset. This will first exclude Google Cloud, and then include all the other Google IP addresses.

Install iptables ''ipset'', and run (as root) the ''ipset-setup.sh'' script, or execute:

<code>
sudo ./ipset-setup.sh
</code>

==== Run ====

<code>
sudo tcpdump -i nflog:20 -ln | ./teller
</code>

Specific app:
<code>
sudo bpftrace netsendmsg.bt |
    grep --line-buffered ^$(pgrep firefox) |
    stdbuf -oL cut -f2 | ./cidr.py | ./teller
</code>
