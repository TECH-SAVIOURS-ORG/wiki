===== Firefox (Vanilla) =====

Pure firefox.

Check also https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox/Privacy and https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox/Tweaks.

==== Package ====

<code>
pacman -S firefox
</code>

==== user.js ====

user.js tutorial based on https://blackgnu.net/firefox-hardening-guide.html. **Thank you** for that!

  - Start Firefox
  - Create a new profile named hardened in ''about:profiles''
    - set it as default
    - close firefox
  - Go to ''~/.mozilla/firefox/'' and look for ''xxxxxxxx.hardened''
    - copy the full name
    - delete the folder.
  - Download the latest version of arkenfoxs user.js at https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/releases
    - extract it
    - rename it to your copied name ''xxxxxxxx.hardened''
    - move the extracted folder to ''~/.mozilla/firefox/''.
  - Start firefox

You can also create your own user.js file at https://ffprofile.com/.

=== Override user.js ===

The following example is based on session recovery being enabled again. If you have pinned tabs or working on something, this can be very helpful. Every time you close your browser and start it again, it is back the way you left it.

If you use searx on your own [[en:desktop:services:searx|computer]]/[[en:server:services:searx|server]], you can also enable keywords for the URL bar to search for something instead of the search bar. This also saves more space.

  - Close firefox
  - Create a ''user-overrides.js'' file in ''~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.hardened/'' with the following content:

<code>
// Enable session restore
user_pref("browser.startup.page", 3);
user_pref("browser.sessionstore.privacy_level", 0);
user_pref("privacy.clearOnShutdown.history", false);
user_pref("privacy.cpd.history", false);

// Enable search in url bar
user_pref("keyword.enabled", true);
</code>

==== Updates of Firefox/arkenfox and changes of the user-overrides.js file ====

  - Run 
    - ''./prefsCleaner.sh''
    - ''./updater.sh''
  - Start firefox

===== Pale Moon =====

Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser completely built from its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, and focuses on efficiency and ease of use by carefully selecting features and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user experience, while offering full customization and a growing collection of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own.

Pale Moon aims to provide close adherence to official web standards and specifications in its implementation (with minimal compromise), and purposefully excludes a number of features to strike a good balance between general use, performance, and technical advancements on the Web.

With the current generation of mainstream browsers, there are also more obvious and not just "under the hood" differences: Pale Moon will continue to provide grouped navigation buttons of a decent size, a bookmarks toolbar that is enabled by default, tabs next to page content by default (easily switchable) and not in the least a functional status bar and more freedom in customization, to name a few things.
