====== OpenSUSE ======

A good security/usability/privacy/freedom compromise operating system that should fit most people's needs.

OpenSUSE comes in 4 different versions. In this guide, we will talk about how to choose the right one, the advantages and disadvantages of each version and how to set them up.

====== Requirements ======

- 2 Ghz dual core processor or better
- 2GB physical RAM + additional memory for your workload
- Over 40GB of free hard drive space
- Either a DVD drive or USB port for the installation media
- Internet access is helpful, and required for the Network Installer
- Having UEFI and Secure Boot will improve security, but it's not required.

====== Download OpenSUSE ======

For OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, you should download it here: https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/

For OpenSUSE Leap, you should download it here: https://get.opensuse.org/leap/

You should do the "Verify your download" step that is also on the download page to make sure your OpenSUSE iso image is safe and sound.

====== Installation ======

OpenSUSE's installer is slow, like //really// slow, especially if you have a slow internet. But the installed system is fine.
