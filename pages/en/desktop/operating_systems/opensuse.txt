====== OpenSUSE ======

A good security/usability/privacy/freedom compromise operating system that should fit most people's needs.

OpenSUSE comes in two different versions, you should choose the one that fits your needs the most:

- OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, a rolling release with fresh software (but that is reliable because it's well-tested by bots and using a nice snapshots system). You want to use this if you have very recent hardware and if you have decent internet bandwidth that can handle the amount of updates it has.

- OpenSUSE Leap, a fixed release that gets a new version every 7 months, it's basically the free (in price) version of SUSE Enterprise Linux. Be aware that OpenSUSE Leap needs to be manually upgraded to the new version using the terminal (see "Upgrading Leap" section).

====== Requirements ======



====== Download OpenSUSE ======

For OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, you should download it here: https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/

For OpenSUSE Leap, you should download it here: https://get.opensuse.org/leap/

====== Installation ======

OpenSUSE's installer is slow, like //really// slow, especially if you have a slow internet. But the installed system is fine
