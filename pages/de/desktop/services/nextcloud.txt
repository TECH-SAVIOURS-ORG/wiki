====== Nextcloud ======

Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. It is functionally similar to Dropbox, although Nextcloud is free and open-source, allowing anyone to install and operate it on a private server. In contrast to proprietary services like Dropbox, the open architecture allows adding additional functionality to the server in form of applications.


===== Packages =====

<code>
pacman -S nextcloud-client
</code>


===== Configuration =====

The configuration is pretty much self explained. Just start the client and login to [[/en/server/services/nextcloud|your server]] (https://nextcloud.home).
